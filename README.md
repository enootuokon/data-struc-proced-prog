ADDING DISTICT ELEMENTS FROM TWO ARRAYS
  This was achieved using a nested loop as seen in the algorithm to traverse through the  Arrays and push distinct elements into an empty array which was used to calculate the sum of the distict elements.

DOT PRODUCT ALGORITHM
Takes 2D vectors and test if the length of the vectors are equal by travesing through the elements in the 2 vectors and comparing their lengths.
The dot_product function is the used in the checkOrthogonal function to determine if the vectorPairs are orthogonal.
